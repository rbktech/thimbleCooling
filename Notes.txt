The distance function (defined on line 26), is a highly sensitive distance function since the leading order terms in x and y are of the order of x^8 and y^8. 

The partial derivatives thus are of the order of x^7 and y^7. Once a random set of points have been generated, if the point is at a large distance from the thimble or anti-thimble, the point is kicked off even further, leading to a very random path which ultimately results in an overflow error.

Reducing the step size is not useful since the above problem still persists, while slowing down the path of points closer to the curves. 

Thus the algorithm is only suited for actions such as Sine-Gordon which are lower order distance functions.
